# CSV2TSV
Simple script to convert a comma separated text file (csv) to a tab separated text file (tsv).

Why would anyone want to do this? Tab separated files are easier to work with on the command line. Especially with utilities such as `cut` and `awk`.

**Usage:**

```
csv2tsv.pl input.csv > output.tsv
```
