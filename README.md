# CSV2TSV
Simple script to Convert a comma separated text file (csv) to a tab separated text file (tsv).

Why would anyone want to do this? Tab separated files are easier to work with on the command line. Specially with utilities such as cut and awk.

**Usage:**

```
csv2tsv.pl input.csv > output.tsv
```
